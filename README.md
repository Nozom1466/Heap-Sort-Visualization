# Heap-Sort-Visualization
Data Structure Project - Heap Sort Visualization

## Notice
This project is adapted from [Data Structure Visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html) where [Heap Sort](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/HeapSort.html) was on the algorithm list.

More Algorithm Visualizations on the website are highly recommended. 

## Quick Start
Open heap_sort.html
![opening page](/pages/opening.png)


`Randomize` - randomize (generate) an array with MAX_LENGTH(default to 32) elements

`Build Heap` - build up a heap & start first visualization 

`Animation Speed Range` - Change the speed of your animation

![Randomize & Build heap](/pages/main_1.png)

`Pause / Start` - pause or start animation

`Back / Forward` - Perform animation by steps (forward / backward)

`FAST Back / FAST Forward` - quickly finish animation / back to origial state

`Update` - Update your array manually

Close the model box then perform the animation
